This report contains a thorough walkthrough of our fourth term project named Quiz Creator. The application does exactly what the name implies: it allows users to create and share quizzes among each other. It is an application where the possibilities are practically endless - whether a teacher wants to create quizzes for his or her students on a certain subject or if students create quizzes for each other to practice before a difficult examination, it is possible with Quiz Creator. 

Work on this project began in early February. From the beginning the team decided to take advantage of the Scrum framework - most of the team members had worked in agile settings before, so it was an obvious choice. And in many aspects the project has been driven forward in an iterative way and this means that the project has been split up in different iterations, where each iteration has added more and more functionality. 

Towards the end of the project most of the essential features found in the use cases have been added to the application. This report will give the reader an overview of how we achieved this result.
