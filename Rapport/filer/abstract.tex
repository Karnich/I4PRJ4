This report contains a thorough walktrough of our fourth semester project named Quiz Creator. The application does exactly what the name implies: it is an application that allows the users to create and share quizzes among each others. It is an application where the possibilites are practically endless - whether a teacher wants to create quizzes for his or her students in a certain subject or if students create quizzes for each other to practice before a diffcult examination it is possible with Quiz Creator. 
Work on this project began in early Febraury. From the beginning the team decided to take advantage of the Scrum framework - most of the team members had worked in agile settings before so it was an obvious choice. And in many aspects the project has been driven forward in an iterative way and this means that the project has been split up in different iterations, where each iteration has added more and more functionality. 
Towards the end og the project most of the essentiel features found in the use cases have been added to the application. This report will give the reader an overview of how we archieved this result.
